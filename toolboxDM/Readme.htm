		<h1>Data Manipulation Toolbox (ver 1.0) Readme</h1>

		<h2>Introduction</h2>
		
		<p>
		Data Manipulation Toolbox (dmtoolbox) is a MATLAB toolbox to 
		facilitate the general programming using various data structures 
		such as string, arrays, cell arrays and struct arrays. 
		Despite that MATLAB has offered a series of builtin functions to 
		manipulate these elements, nontrivial efforts are still needed to 
		accomplish some advanced operations. 
		This toolbox aims at complementing some functions that MATLAB currently 
		lacks instead of replacing the existing ones. 
		</p>
		
		<p>
		Here is a brief list of the functionality offered by the dmtoolbox 
		<dl class="featurelist">
		<dt>Common Utilities</dt>
		<dd><p>The functions for logical judgment, conditional counting, array selection, 
			and the computation of Cartesian product.</p></dd>
			
		<dt>String Manipulation and Formatting</dt>
		<dd><p>The functions for generating strings in different types, formatting strings, 
			extracting information from strings, and converting strings.</p></dd>
			
		<dt>Cell Array Manipulation</dt>
		<dd><p>The functions for logical judgment, conditional counting, element selection, 
			selective removal, and conversion of cell arrays.</p></dd>
			
		<dt>Struct Array Manipulation</dt>
		<dd><p>The functions for sorting and converting struct arrays from/to different data structures.</p></dd>
		
		<dt>Mapping (Look-Up-Table)</dt>
		<dd><p>The functions to construct maps(also known as dictionary, hash table, or loop-up-table), 
			and map a scalar or a string to the corresponding value.</p></dd>
			
		<dt>Unit Testing Framework</dt>
		<dd><p>It is a flexible and lightweight framework with classes and functions to assist unit testing 
			in MATLAB. You can make use of the framework to write testing functions with assertions, group 
			them into test cases and test suites. The framework monitors the running of all test cases and 
			records all assertion checking results and exceptions, and reports to the user as well.</p></dd>
		</dl>
		</p>
		
		<p>
		Elaborate help has been provided within each m-function, with sufficient examples to show their usage. 
		In addition, well-formated HTML help of this toolbox is made available in the MATLAB Help Browser. 
		You can readily refer to it by finding the Data Manipulation Toolbox in the list of MATLAB Help Contents 
		or simply typing <i>dmdoc</i> in MATLAB command line. 
		</p>
		
		<p>
		To assure the quality, a comprehensive testsuite has been written to check whether all functions 
		work properly. After installing the toolbox, you may type in <i>dmtoolbox_test</i> to run the tests to 
		verify that the toolbox can work normally in your MATLAB environment. The whole testsuite is written 
		based on the unit testing framework offered in the toolbox, which in itself is a good example to show 
		how to use the testing framework. 
		</p>
		
		<h2>Installation</h2>
		
		<p>
		To install the dmtoolbox into your MATLAB environment, you may follow the instructions below:
		<ol>
			<li>Unzip the toolbox to any place that you like;</li>
			<li>Enter MATLAB Environment;</li>
			<li>Switch to the root directory of the toolbox;</li>
			<li>Type in <q class="cmd">dmtoolbox_install</q>, then the program will automatically add all required paths;</li>
			<li>Some functions are based on C-MEX files. In the downloaded package, they have been compiled in MATLAB R2007a.
				If you are in lower version, you may need to re-compile them. You can type in
				<q class="cmd">dmtoolbox_install -mex</q> to accomplish this. </li>
			<li>To check whether the toolbox has been correctly deployed, type in <q class="cmd">dmtoolbox_test</q>. 
				Thereby, the testsuites for the whole toolbox will be run, and a report will be printed on the command
				window. This process takes no more than 1 minute in a typical machine.</li>
		</ol>
		If all steps go well, you can now start using the toolbox.
		</p>
		
		<h2>Get Help</h2>
		<p>
		All functions in the toolbox are sufficiently documented. There are a variety of ways to get help.
		<ul>
			<li>Type in <q class="cmd">help <i>function_name</i></q> to get the help of a specified function. 
			This displays the text help in the command window.</li>
			<li>Type in <q class="cmd">dmdoc <i>function_name</i></q> to get the help of a specified function or module 
			in form of HTML Web page. This opens the built-in help browser of MATLAB and shows the help page.</li>
			<li>Open the help browser, in the left-hand-side contents catalog, you will find an item called 
			<i>Data Manipulation Toolbox</i> if the toolbox has been installed correctly. You can find all documents 
			in HTML form there.</li>
		</ul>
