% RUNE - Rudimentary Network Emulator
%
% is a set of Matlab functions that makes it possible 
% to simulate a cellular network. The functions are
% structured in the following folders:
% 
% runetools/ - general purpose functions (e.q. matrix handling)
% runegain/  - functions needed for simulating any kind of cellular
%              system. Generates the gain matrix
% runetdma/  - algorithms specific for a TDMA system
% runecdma/  - algorithms specific for a CDMA system
% examples/  - examples of how to use RUNE
%
% setpath    - sets the Matlab path for simulations
% setp       - Wrapper for setpath that can be run without beeing on the path
