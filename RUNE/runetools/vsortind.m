function indi = vsortind(xi,xv,dim)
% DESCRIPTION indi = vsortind(xi,xv,dim)
%  xi and xv will be expanded to equal size for all dimensions except dim
%  For each value of xi an index is calculated so that
%  the index to the maximum value of xv not exceeds the 
%  corresponding value in xi. The output will receive the combined size of
%  xv and xi except for dimension dim where the size is that of xi
%  Make shure that the input argument xv is either increasing or decreasing
%  along the dimension dim.
%  Note that first xv-value along dim has nothing to do with the result
% 
% INPUT
%  xi --  a real matrix for which index is going to be created. 
%  xv --  a real matrix that is either increasing or decreasing along
%         dimension dim into which indi is pointingf
%  dim -- dimension along xv in which index will be fitted 
% OUTPUT 
%  indi -- A matrix with indices into xv such that xi <= xv(indi)
