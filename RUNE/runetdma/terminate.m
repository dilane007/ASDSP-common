 function [bter, kter, obkn] = terminate(b, k, obk, term)
% DESCRIPTION [bter, kter, obkn] = terminate(b, k, obk, term)
% Terminates calls. Essentially the channels that the calls occupied are
% marked as free again.
% INPUT
%  b --      Base index for each link. Size is #links by one. 
%  k --      Channel index for each link.  Size is #links by one.
%            The value NaN indicates not in use.
%  obk --    Binary matrix. Zero indicate occupied channel.
%  term --   A binary vector of the same size as b and k indicating
%            which links that are going to be released.
% OUTPUT
%  bter --   Has the same size as respectively b.
%  kter --   Nan in all places where calls where terminated. Has the same size as k.
%  obkn --   Reflects the new allocation in the system. Has the same size as obk.
