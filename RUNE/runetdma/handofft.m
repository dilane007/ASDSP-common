function [bho, kho, offern] = handofft(b, k, g, offer, homargin)
% DESCRIPTION [bho, kho, offern] = handofft(b, k, g, offer, homargin)
%  No handoff will be performed on b and k with values NaN. 
%  When base is selected an advantage is set to currently used
%  channel by homargin [dB].
% INPUT
%  b --         Base index for each link. Size is #links by one.
%               Elements of b that is equal to NaN are 
%               not going to be handed off. 
%  k --         Channel index for each link. Size is #links by one.
%               The value NaN indicates no hand off to this base. 
%  g --         Gain matrix with gain values in dB. Size is #links by #bases
%  offer --     Binary matrix. Zero indicate occupied channel. 
%               Size #bases by #channels.
%  homargin --  Standard deviation of the noise added to the
%               gain matrix when base selection is made. [dB]
% OUTPUT
%  bho --       As b but possibly with new base stations.
%  kho --       As k but possibly with new channels when
%               handoff was possible. Otherwise the old base and
%               channel would be kept.
%  offern --    Same size as offer but with new base station-
%               channel combination marked as occupied (zero)
%               and the old one released (set to one).
% TRY 
%  [b,k,offer]=handofft(1,1,[-100 -90],[0;1],0)
%   One link connected to base 1. Two bases, each with one 
%   channel are available. No noise is added.
%  [b,k,offer]=handofft(1,1,[-100 -90],[0 1;1 1],3)
%   One link connected to base 1. Two bases, each with two 
%   channels are available. 3 dB noise is added.
